# Good Is Better Than Perfect

This is a lightning talk that I gave at [Codebar](http://codebar.io) in June 2015, loosely based on [*A Dao of Web Design*](http://alistapart.com/article/dao/) by John Allsop.

The transcript of my talk is below and the slides are at http://richardwestenra.com/dao/.

The slides run on [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). The original readme for this repo is [here](README-RevealJS.md).

## Transcript 

0. Hey, I’m Richard. I’m a front-end developer and interactive designer at Distilled. I make JavaScript data-visualisations, interactives, and web appy type stuff.
I want to talk to you about how sometimes good is better than perfect.

1. But first, I want you take you way back in time to the year 2000.
This was a bit before my time so if any of you spot something I’ve got wrong, let me know. 
But basically, 2000 was the Dark Ages of web development. 

2. It was the the time of the First Browser War.

3. Internet Explorer 5 was crushing Netscape 4.5, 

4. And people were arguing about whether this newfangled CSS thing would take off. 

5. At the time, there was a bit of a culture war going on. Most designers had come from a print design background, and they were used to having complete control over how their finished designs would look. 
But the web meant new challenges for designers. When you design for the web, you have to take into account that people will be viewing your web page on loads of different computers, and it’ll look completely different from one computer to the next.

6. You’ve got to consider different screen sizes and resolutions, different colours, brightness and contrast, different system fonts and default font-sizes, and then on top of all that you’ve got different browsers with different rendering engines, each with their own idiosyncratic interpretations of web standards.

7. And at this point, along comes this bloke from Australia called John Allsop. He’s often regarded as the great-grandad of responsive web design, mainly because he wrote this article in A List Apart called [*A Dao of Web Design*](http://alistapart.com/article/dao/).
John Allsop argued that we had to start thinking about design differently, because we’re working with a totally different medium. And he told print designers, “Stop trying to control everything! Let it go!”

8. Because when it comes down to it, the flexibility and ubiquity of the web aren’t problems, they’re possibilities. They make the web more adaptable and more accessible. They mean we can do things we could never have imagined fifteen years ago.

9. But that’s ancient history. Let’s come back to 2015. We live in the future! 

10. We have self-driving cars!

11. And virtual reality!

12. And whatever this is!

13. So on the one hand, we now have all these fancy tools, APIs and frameworks. It’s quicker and easier than ever to make fancy web stuff, and we have more control over how our designs will look.

14. But on the other hand, we’ve also got more things to consider than ever before. We have dozens of browsers and hundreds of versions running on thousands of devices. We’ve all got smartphones in our pockets, and tablets, and phablets, and smart watches, and you can even browse the web on your glasses 
15. if you don’t mind looking like a bit of a tool.

16. So it’s still really hard to make things perfect. In fact it’s harder than ever. We have great power, but we still don't have complete control.

17.  Often we end up pushing and pushing for perfection, but we’re up against the law of diminishing returns.  What that means is that beyond a certain point, the more you put into something, the less you get for each extra bit of investment. And as you get closer and closer to the finish line, eventually you reach a point where the gain is not worth the pain.

18. So for example, I recently completed a data-vis project that had exactly this problem. We got it built in just a few days, but then it got stuck in redesign hell for weeks, as we went back and forth over things that we weren’t quite happy with. 

19.  This is the 80/20 rule: You can often complete 80% of the project in 20% of the time, but getting from there to the end is a slog. And sometimes spending five times as long to nail that last 20% is just not worth it.

20. So whenever you start some work on a task, first take a step back and consider how necessary it is.
	- How many of your users will be affected?
	- How crucial is it? Will anyone die? Government, medical, etc.
	- What is the opportunity cost?

21. And this applies whether you’re adding a new feature, browser testing, or bug-fixing or even just deciding whether it’s worthwhile taking your time to write some really beautiful code, or whether to just churn out a quick and dirty hack.
Because being a good developer isn’t just writing good code. It’s also about having the knowledge to make good cost-benefit calculations. Sometimes you need push for perfection, but other times, you’ve just gotta let it go.

22. Thanks!

23. By the way, I just want to quickly plug my company Distilled. We’re just over in London Bridge, and we’re currently hiring.
	- It’s the best place I’ve ever worked.
	- It’s a really smart bunch of people.
	- We make a lot of really cool stuff, and work on a lot of fun projects.
	- Come talk to me if you’re interested!
