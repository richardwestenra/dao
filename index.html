						<p>Hey, I’m Richard. I’m a front-end developer and interactive designer at Distilled. I make JS data-vis, interactives, and web appy type stuff.</p>
						<p>I want to talk to you about how sometimes good is better than perfect.</p>
						<p>...But first, I want you take you way back in time to the year 2000.</p>

					<h1 class="title-big">2000</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This was a bit before my time, so if I’ve got anything wrong, please let me know.</p>
						<p>But basically, 2000 was the Dark Ages of web development.</p>
					</aside>

				<section data-background="img/browserwar.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>It was the the time of the First Browser War.</p>
						<p>...Internet Explorer 5 was crushing Netscape 4.5.</p>

					<h1>Print Designers</h1>
					<p>versus</p>
					<h1>Web Designers</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Most designers then came from a print design background, and they were used to having complete control over how their finished designs would look.</p> 
						<p>But the web meant new challenges for designers. When you design for the web, you have to take into account that people will be viewing your web page on loads of different computers, and it’ll look completely different from one computer to the next.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/ie.png" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>You’ve got to consider different screen sizes and resolutions,</p>
						 <p>different colours, brightness and contrast,</p>
						 <p>different system fonts and default font-sizes,</p>
						 <p>and then on top of all that you’ve got different browsers with different rendering engines, each with their own idiosyncratic interpretations of web standards.</p>
					</aside>

				<section data-background="img/ala.jpg">
					<p class="ala"><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/dao/">alistapart.com/article/dao</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>And at this point, along comes this bloke from Australia called John Allsop. John Allsop is often regarded as the great-grandad of responsive web design, mainly because he wrote this article in A List Apart called A Dao of Web Design.</p>
						<!-- <p>(btw it’s really great, I recommend checking it out).</p> -->
						<p>He argued that we had to start thinking about design differently, because we’re working with a totally different medium. And he told print designers, “Stop trying to control everything! Let it go!”</p>

				<section>
					<h1>The Chaos is a strength</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Because when it comes down to it, the flexibility and ubiquity of the web aren’t problems, they’re possibilities.</p>
						<p>They make the web more accessible, and mean we can do things we could never have imagined fifteen years ago, in the days of yore.</p>

					<h1>New tools</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>(So on the one hand, we now have all these fancy tools, APIs and frameworks.)</p>
						<p>It’s quicker and easier than ever to make fancy web stuff, and we have more control over how our designs will look.</p>
					</aside>

				<section data-background="img/devices.gif" data-background-size="contain">
					<h1>New problems</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>On the other hand, we now have dozens of browsers and hundreds of versions running on thousands of devices.</p>
						<p>We’ve all got smartphones in our pockets, and tablets, and phablets, and smart watches, and you can even browse the web on your glasses</p>
						<p>...if you don't mind looking like a tool.</p>
					</aside>

				<section data-background="img/glass.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
					<h3 style="margin-top: 7em;">New tools?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>(if you don't mind looking like a tool.)</p>
						<p>...So it’s still really hard to make things perfect.</p>

				<section>
					<h1>Perfection<br> is hard</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>(So it’s still really hard to make things perfect.)</p>
						<p>In fact it’s harder than ever. We have great power, but we still don't have complete control.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/diminishingreturns.svg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Often we end up pushing and pushing for perfection, but we’re up against the law of diminishing returns.</p>
						<p>What that means is that beyond a certain point, the more you put into something, the less you get for each extra bit of investment.</p>
						<p>And as you get closer and closer to the finish line, eventually you reach a point where the gain is not worth the pain.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/diminishingreturns2.svg" data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So for example, I recently completed a data-vis project that had exactly this problem.</p>
						<p>We got it built in just a few days, but then it got stuck in redesign hell for weeks, as we went back and forth over things that we weren’t quite happy with.</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h1>The 80/20 rule</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This is the 80/20 rule: You can often complete 80% of the project in 20% of the time, but getting from there to the end is a slog.</p>
						<p>And sometimes spending five times as long to nail that last 20% is just not worth it.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Effort</h1>
					<p>versus</p>
					<h1>Results</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So whenever you start some work on a task, take a step back and consider whether it’s worth it.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>How necessary is the work? Is it worth your time?</li>
							<li>How many of your users will be affected?</li>
							<li>How crucial? Will anyone die? Government, medical, etc.</li>
							<li>What is the opportunity cost?</li>
						</ul>

					<h1>Let it go</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>And this applies whether you’re adding a new feature, browser testing, or bug-fixing or even just deciding whether it’s worthwhile taking your time to write some really beautiful code, or whether to just churn out a quick and dirty hack.</p>
						<p>Because being a good developer isn’t just writing good code. It’s also about having the knowledge to make good cost-benefit calculations. Sometimes you need push for perfection, but other times, you’ve just gotta let it go.</p>
